# Adobe_Challenge1b
Adobe hackathon project.

You're working on a system that:

Loads multiple PDF documents.

Embeds them using a transformer model (sentence-transformers).

Stores those embeddings.

Takes a JSON query (with a "persona") as input.

Uses the query to rank the most relevant document sections based on cosine similarity.

Outputs a result JSON with filenames and relevant content snippets.

ðŸ§  Command-line Arguments Explained
Your code is designed to be run like this from terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python solve_round1b.py --docs_dir=./docs --query_file=input.json --output_file=output.json
Hereâ€™s what each argument means:

1. --docs_dir=./docs
Purpose: Path to the folder containing your .pdf documents.

Example: ./docs means all PDFs in the folder named docs (in the current directory) will be read.

Challenge: Make sure only PDFs are in this folder, or code might try to read invalid files.

2. --query_file=input.json
Purpose: Path to your query input file (usually in JSON).

Contents: Should include:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "persona": "Some persona description or task"
}
Challenge: The file must be valid JSON with a "persona" key, or the program will crash or behave unexpectedly.

3. --output_file=output.json
Purpose: Path to write the final output results in JSON format.

Output Includes:

Relevance scores for each document.

Best-matching sections from top files.

File names.

Challenge: Make sure the directory you write to exists; if not, Python will throw a FileNotFoundError.

âš  Common Issues and Mistakes
Problem	Cause	Fix
error: unrecognized arguments	You misspelled an argument name	Use double dashes (--) and check spelling
PDF not read	PDF is encrypted or corrupted	Use a simpler or re-exported PDF
KeyError: 'persona'	JSON input file missing "persona" key	Check input file format
Output file is empty	All cosine scores were zero or low	Try stronger query phrasing
Stuck terminal	Python process didnâ€™t release	Use Ctrl+C to stop or restart terminal


If you want to test without command-line arguments, add the following block to the bottom of your solve_round1b.py file:

python
Copy
Edit
if _name_ == "_main_":
    import sys
    sys.argv = ["solve_round1b.py", 
                "--docs_dir=./docs", 
                "--query_file=input.json", 
                "--output_file=output.json"]
    main()
This simulates the arguments and lets you just run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python solve_round1b.py
in the terminal with no flags needed.
