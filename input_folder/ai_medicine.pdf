Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine refers to the application of AI techniques to improve healthcare,
encompassing areas like diagnosis, treatment, drug discovery, and patient care. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data, 
including patient records, medical images, and genomic information, to identify patterns and predict outcomes with greater accuracy than traditional methods. 
This can lead to more precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and faster drug development.
